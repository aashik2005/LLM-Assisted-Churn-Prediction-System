# LLM-Assisted-Churn-Prediction-System
LLM-powered churn prediction system for telecom customer data using SQLite, with persistent decision storage and natural language analysis.


Project Description

This project is an LLM-powered churn prediction and decision intelligence system developed using telecom customer data. The raw dataset is initially sourced from Excel and transformed into a SQLite relational database to enable efficient storage, querying, and data management.

The system retrieves structured customer data from SQLite and applies an LLM-assisted analysis layer to identify churn risks, behavioral patterns, and retention insights. Based on this analysis, the model generates decisions and explanations using natural language reasoning. All predictions and decisions are persistently stored in a separate SQLite table, allowing traceability, auditing, and historical analysis of churn trends.

By integrating large language models with traditional database systems, this project demonstrates a practical example of LLM-augmented analytics for business intelligence. It showcases how AI-driven reasoning can enhance structured data analysis without relying on vector databases or retrieval-augmented generation, making it suitable for real-world decision-support systems in the telecom domain.
